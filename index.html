      <h1 class="display-4">Gaming</h1>

      <p>
        I love Gaming. It relieves my stress (I guess). I do gaming sessions at
        my free time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I sometimes play alone or with some random players. I play with my
        friends only if they are online.

      <h1 class="display-4">Cycling</h1>

      <p>
        I do cycling cause its a part of exercise And it helps people to grow
        taller.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cycling also sometimes burns calories thats why its also a part of gym.
